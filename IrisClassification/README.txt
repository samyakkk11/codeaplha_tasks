# Iris Flower Classification

This project implements a simple machine learning model to classify Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements using Logistic Regression.

**1. Introduction**

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning used for classification tasks. This project demonstrates a basic workflow for loading, exploring, and classifying the Iris dataset using Python and scikit-learn.

**2. Installation**

To run this script, you'll need the following libraries:

*   **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **scikit-learn:** For machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing.
*   **matplotlib:** For basic plotting.
*   **seaborn:** For enhanced data visualization.

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
